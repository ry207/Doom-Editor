Building as an Executable

Follow the steps below to convert the Doom Text Editor into an executable on Linux, Windows, and macOS.
Linux (e.g., Arch Linux)


```
pyinstaller --onefile --windowed main.py
```
This will generate a standalone executable in the dist folder.


    Create a .desktop file in ~/.local/share/applications/.

```
[nano/vim/nvim/etc...] ~/path/to/project/folder/[chosen_nameof_desktop_file].desktop
```


    Add the following content to the file:
```
    [Desktop Entry]
    Name=Doom Text Editor
    Comment=Advanced Text Editor with Doom Vibes
    Exec=/home/username/path/to/DoomTextEditor
    Icon=/home/username/path/to/icon.png
    Terminal=false
    Type=Application
    Categories=Utility;TextEditor;
```
Replace /home/username/path/to/DoomTextEditor with the actual path to your executable, and update the Icon path as needed.

Update the Application Database: Run the following command to register the desktop entry:
```
    update-desktop-database ~/.local/share/applications/
```
    You should now be able to find Doom Text Editor in your applications menu.

Windows

    Generate the Executable: Use PyInstaller to create an .exe:
```
    pyinstaller --onefile --windowed main.py
```

    This will place an executable in the dist folder.

    Create a Shortcut:
        Right-click the DoomTextEditor.exe file and select Create shortcut.
        Move the shortcut to your Start menu or desktop.

    Add an Icon (Optional):
        Right-click the shortcut and select Properties.
        Under the Shortcut tab, click Change Icon and select your custom icon file.

    Launch Doom Text Editor:
        Now, you can launch Doom Text Editor directly from the shortcut on your desktop or Start menu.

macOS

    Generate the Executable:
        Run PyInstaller to create a macOS app bundle:

```
        pyinstaller --onefile --windowed main.py
```

    Add Application Metadata:
        In the dist folder, rename the output to DoomTextEditor.app.
        Place the app in your /Applications directory for easy access.

    Add Icon (Optional):
        Use macOS tools like Icon Composer or Image2Icon to convert an image to .icns format.
        Add the .icns file to your appâ€™s Resources directory, then update the .plist to reflect the icon change.
