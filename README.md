Building as an Executable

Follow the steps below to convert the Doom Text Editor into an executable on Linux, Windows, and macOS.
Linux (e.g., Arch Linux)

    Generate the Executable: Use PyInstaller to create an executable:

pyinstaller --onefile --windowed main.py

This will generate a standalone executable in the dist folder.

Create a Desktop Entry:

    Create a file named DoomTextEditor.desktop in ~/.local/share/applications/.

    Add the following content to the file:

    [Desktop Entry]
    Name=Doom Text Editor
    Comment=Advanced Text Editor with Doom Vibes
    Exec=/home/username/path/to/DoomTextEditor
    Icon=/home/username/path/to/icon.png
    Terminal=false
    Type=Application
    Categories=Utility;TextEditor;

Replace /home/username/path/to/DoomTextEditor with the actual path to your executable, and update the Icon path as needed.

Update the Application Database: Run the following command to register the desktop entry:

    update-desktop-database ~/.local/share/applications/

    You should now be able to find Doom Text Editor in your applications menu.

Windows

    Generate the Executable: Use PyInstaller to create an .exe:

    pyinstaller --onefile --windowed main.py

    This will place an executable in the dist folder.

    Create a Shortcut:
        Right-click the DoomTextEditor.exe file and select Create shortcut.
        Move the shortcut to your Start menu or desktop.

    Add an Icon (Optional):
        Right-click the shortcut and select Properties.

        Place the app in your /Applications directory for easy access.

    Add Icon (Optional):
